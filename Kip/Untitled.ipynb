    "# Project Description/Outline\n",
    "We merged county health data and demographic data for Texas for 2019 with two classifications of Urban and Rural. Then we  settled on a dependent health outcome measure and determined if there is a statistical difference between the Urban and Rural counties. Next we found correlated factors that have an impact on health outcomes compared by counties. Finally we summarized the top and bottom 5 counties for health outcome.\n",

    "## Acquired datasets: \n",
    "#### Urban vs Rural - How did we define Urban and Rural?\n",
    "We used the Texas Health Professions Resource Center (HPRC) [Definitions of County Designations](https://dshs.texas.gov/chs/hprc/counties.shtm) to imported an excel file. \n",

    "After reading more on the subject we found a system to classify Urban and Rural into six subcategories\n",
    "at the [CDC NCHS Urban Rural Classification System](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm#Data_Files_and_Documentation)\n",
    "The deeper classification splits up urban into four groups making a distinction between inner-city large population counties and suburb large population counties. You can see the clusters on a map from their website.\n",

    "## Cleaning of Datasets: \n",
    "Excel files will be merges in both an [Excel Workbook](output/2019_County_Health_Texas_Data_Kip.xlsx) and in a [Jupyter notebook](output/Urban_Rural_Health_Texas.ipynb) A preliminary analysis was done in the Excel Workbook to examine correlations to help decide what factors to analyze in Pandas.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The conclusion is that Household income correlates with Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate. But what appears to be the case is that as you move out of the city people make less than a certain amount of money on average. Making more money is what seems to be what is improving health outcomes, and rural counties don't have an average income high enough so their outcome is worse.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban counties fare better than Rural counties. After looking at hundreds of correlations in Excel and Pandas and narrowing them down to plot and regress them, it appears as though Income is what accounts for most of the difference. We split the outcomes by race - White, Black and Hispanic to further see if we could examine this link. What we found was overall Income correlated for Whites and Blacks because they both achieved the higher average income in more populous areas. For Hispanics we didn't see this correlation, but that is probably because they don't earn enough. Other factors we examined like Teen Pregnancy when a high % of the population track with the lower health outcomes. \n",
    "Health beahviors such as % Smokers and % Inactive also saw worse outcomes the hight those percentages were in the county - this is no surprise.\n",
